==================================

Introduction.
-------------
The PyOSLC project was developed as set of classes and libraries packaged 
as a SDK which is aimed to build REST-based APIâ€™s that allows us 
to implement OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) projects 
that meet the specifications for creating REST services to enable 
the interoperability of heterogeneous products and services.
